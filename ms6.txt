Block creation:
We created blocks based on the zip code of each dirty restaurant that we evaluated. In order to avoid the creation of the same block several times, we have a set that keeps track of restaurant_id that were already grouped into a block.
We chose xip code as an attribute to group by to allow for smaller blocks than with state or city attributes. 

Index creation:
We created the index in temporary tables after blocking. The attribute that we used was address. Although, we are aware that there could be matches that we miss because of typos. 


Primary record creation:
First, we evaluated if the one of the ids that we flagged as match was already as primary record id in ri_linked. If it wasn't there we created a new primary record. If it was, we delete that record and create a new one that take into account all matches' attributes. 
To create the new primary record we use the DEFAULT option for id, and choose the longest name, as well as the most frequent facility type, state, city, zip.
