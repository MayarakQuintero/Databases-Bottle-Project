Hours spent: 6 hours each

The total time reported WITHOUT index is 3,456,772.71 ms and the total time reported WITH index is 3,172,202.79 ms, which represents 8.3% less time with index than without it. 
The above agrees with theory: indexes help queries to be more efficient. 

Another way to analyze this is based on the interpretation of Latency Percentiles:

Percentile | WITHOUT Index | WITH Index
---------------------------------------
50th	   |	56 ms      |	53 ms   
95th	   |	132	ms	   |	110 ms
99th	   |	293	ms	   |	247 ms
100th	   |	3759 ms    |	1343 ms

The experiment with indexes outperformed the one without them. For example, on one hand, WITHOUT indexes the whole sample took less or equal to 3,759 ms per transaction. 
On the other hand, WITH indexed the whole sample took less or equal to 1,343 ms per transaction.
